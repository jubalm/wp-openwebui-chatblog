## Product Requirements Document: IONOS MKS PoC (Managed DBs, OpenWebUI, Authentik with MCP)

### 1. Introduction & Overview

This document outlines the requirements for a Proof of Concept (PoC) project. The primary goal is to demonstrate the deployment, integration, and operation of a suite of interconnected applications (OpenWebUI, multiple WordPress instances, Authentik) on IONOS Managed Kubernetes (MKS). The PoC will leverage IONOS Managed Database services (MariaDB for each WordPress tenant, PostgreSQL for Authentik) and will utilize Terraform for infrastructure provisioning. A key integration point is a custom "ModelContextProtocol" (MCP) enabling communication between OpenWebUI and each WordPress instance. This PoC aims to validate the chosen technology stack and integration patterns on the IONOS Cloud platform, with a core focus on multi-tenancy: a single OpenWebUI and Authentik instance, and multiple isolated WordPress instances (one per tenant).

### Current Deployment Status (July 8, 2025)

  - **FR6.3 (MCP Flow):** A user logged into OpenWebUI can use its interface (leveraging the IONOS LLM) to generate content, and then use an OpenWebUI feature to send this content as a draft blog post to their connected WordPress instance via MCP. The draft should appear in WordPress.

- **FR7: Secrets Management (GitHub Actions)**
  - **FR7.1:** Sensitive values (IONOS token, DBaaS bootstrap passwords if manually set, OpenWebUI Admin API token for WP plugin) shall be stored as encrypted secrets in GitHub Actions.
  - **FR7.2:** GitHub Actions workflows shall use these secrets to:
    - Authenticate Terraform for infrastructure provisioning.
    - Populate Kubernetes Secrets with database connection details (sourced from Terraform outputs) and other application API keys.

### 7. Technical Requirements

- **TR1: Infrastructure:** All infrastructure defined in Terraform, deployed in IONOS `de/txl` region. Use minimal viable resource sizes.
- **TR2: Containerization:** All applications deployed as Docker containers on MKS. WordPress image to be custom-built to include necessary plugins.
- **TR3: Networking:**
  - Internal communication between pods (e.g., OWUI to WordPress MCP) will use Kubernetes internal DNS service names.
  - External access to UIs via IP-based Kubernetes Ingress.
- **TR4: State Persistence:** Terraform state in IONOS S3. Application data via Kubernetes PVCs.
- **TR5: Namespacing:** Use `admin-apps` for Authentik & OpenWebUI, and `wordpress-tenants` for WordPress.

### 8. Assumptions

- **A1:** IONOS MKS, Managed DBaaS, and Object Storage services in `de/txl` meet the basic functional needs for this PoC.
- **A2:** Minimal viable instance/tier sizes for MKS and DBaaS are sufficient for PoC functionality (performance is not a primary goal).
- **A3:** The IONOS-provided OpenAI-compatible LLM endpoint is available and functions as expected with standard OpenAI API key and base URL configuration.
- **A4 (Critical for FR5):** OpenWebUI provides an administrative API that allows:
  - Programmatic creation of user accounts.
  - Programmatic association of an external API token (the WordPress Application Password) with a user account for outbound API calls from OpenWebUI.
  - _If A4 is false, FR5 functionality will need significant re-evaluation and simplification._
- **A5:** The chosen open-source OIDC client plugin for WordPress integrates correctly with Authentik.
- **A6:** The Automattic `wordpress-mcp` plugin (v0.2.2) is suitable for the MCP communication needs.
- **A7:** IP-based access is sufficient for PoC validation; no DNS names or TLS setups are required for external access.

### 9. Open Questions / Research Items

- **OQ1:** Confirm the exact smallest instance types/tiers for `ionoscloud_k8s_node_pool`, `ionoscloud_dbaas_mariadb_cluster`, and `ionoscloud_dbaas_postgres_cluster` in `de/txl`.
- **OQ2:** Verify the specific environment variable names OpenWebUI expects for `OPENAI_API_BASE_URL` and `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
- **OQ3 (Critical for FR5):** Investigate and confirm OpenWebUI's Admin API capabilities regarding user creation and storage of third-party API tokens for users (ref A4).
- **OQ4:** Select and confirm the specific open-source OIDC SSO client plugin for WordPress and its configuration requirements. (Candidate: OpenID Connect Generic Client by daggerhart).
- **OQ5:** Determine the best strategy for the WordPress Docker image (official Apache-based vs. FPM + separate Nginx pod container) for simplicity vs. flexibility within the PoC.
- **OQ6:** Define the exact mechanism/API endpoint by which OpenWebUI will "send a draft to WordPress" via MCP. (Assumed to be part of OpenWebUI's native features when an MCP integration is configured).
